  Fundamental system principles
- What are the main system principles?

<ol>
  <li>
    System Interactions - Systems, products, and services need to engage with and respond to external systems and dynamic conditions in their operating environment through peer-level or hierarchical types of interactions.\ 
    Interactions can be cooperative, supportive, competitive, or even hostile, aggressive, or defensive, or combination of them.\
  </li>
  <li>
    Behaviours, Production, Higher-Order Dependencies
  </li>
  <li>
    Equilibrium - The term attributes describes a system’s quality traits or physical features that may be objective—observable and measurable—or subjective. Examples include system/product name, model, serial number, contract number, unit cost, and fixed-wing aircraft versus rotorcraft.
  </li>
  <li>
    The balance of power - system existence and survival are determined by its ability to cope with the statics and dynamics of its operating environment
  </li>
  <li>
    User Benefits - Every sistem, product or service must provide six benefits to stakeholders to be considered worthy of their consideration for missions: (Operational) Utility, Suitability, Availability, Usability, Effectiveness, Efficiency
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer Needs - Success in developing systems, products, or services for Enterprises and requires that you understand the who, what, when, where, and how they will purchase.
  </li>
  <li>
    System Existence - every system, product or service has a purpose and exists for the benefit of performing missions for its stakeholders (users, end users)
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer's Customer - To fully understand and support a customer as a System User, we must understand what their customers—the System’s End Users—expect from them and the enabling role your system, product, and service contributes to the accomplishment of those results.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dual producer-supplier roles
  </li>
</ol>
  
- How should a problem statement be formulated?

  Steps to formulate problem statement:
  <ol>
    <li>Clearly and concisely define the problem or issue in one sentence</li>
    <li>Avoid identifying the source or root cause of a problem</li>
    <li>Identify the operational scenario or operating conditions under which the problem occurs or leads to occurrence of the problem</li>
    <li>Avoid stating any explicit or implicit solutions</li>
    <li>Avoid assigning responsibility or blame</li>
  </ol>

  Problem statement example - What is the general problem-solving model?  “We are failing to meet the increasing demands and expectations of our customers. “
