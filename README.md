  Fundamental system principles
- What are the main system principles?

<ol>
  <li>
    System Interactions - Systems, products, and services need to engage with and respond to external systems and dynamic conditions in their operating environment through peer-level or hierarchical types of interactions.\ 
    Interactions can be cooperative, supportive, competitive, or even hostile, aggressive, or defensive, or combination of them.\
  </li>
  <li>
    Behaviours, Production, Higher-Order Dependencies
  </li>
  <li>
    Equilibrium - The term attributes describes a system’s quality traits or physical features that may be objective—observable and measurable—or subjective. Examples include system/product name, model, serial number, contract number, unit cost, and fixed-wing aircraft versus rotorcraft.
  </li>
  <li>
    The balance of power - system existence and survival are determined by its ability to cope with the statics and dynamics of its operating environment
  </li>
  <li>
    User Benefits - Every sistem, product or service must provide six benefits to stakeholders to be considered worthy of their consideration for missions: (Operational) Utility, Suitability, Availability, Usability, Effectiveness, Efficiency
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer Needs - Success in developing systems, products, or services for Enterprises and requires that you understand the who, what, when, where, and how they will purchase.
  </li>
  <li>
    System Existence - every system, product or service has a purpose and exists for the benefit of performing missions for its stakeholders (users, end users)
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer's Customer - To fully understand and support a customer as a System User, we must understand what their customers—the System’s End Users—expect from them and the enabling role your system, product, and service contributes to the accomplishment of those results.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dual producer-supplier roles
  </li>
</ol>
  
- How should a problem statement be formulated?

  Steps to formulate problem statement:
  <ol>
    <li>Clearly and concisely define the problem or issue in one sentence</li>
    <li>Avoid identifying the source or root cause of a problem</li>
    <li>Identify the operational scenario or operating conditions under which the problem occurs or leads to occurrence of the problem</li>
    <li>Avoid stating any explicit or implicit solutions</li>
    <li>Avoid assigning responsibility or blame</li>
  </ol>

## Business Rules Analysis  
What is a business rule? What are the common sources of business rules?  

<ul>
  <li>What is a business rule?</li>
  A business rule is a specific, testable directive that guides behaviour, shapes decisions, or judgments. It must be predictable and under business control
  <li>Common sources of business rules</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit sources (documented) - policies, regulations, contracts, standards, governance rules</li>
      <li>Implicit sources (undocumented) - stakeholder know-how, accepted practices, company culture, informal decisions, market expectations</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

What are the characteristics of business rules? What are the main principles of business rule formulation? 

<ul>
  <li>Characteristics of business rules</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit - clearly stated</li>
      <li>Specific - unambigious</li>
      <li>Clear - understandable to all stakeholders</li>
      <li>Accessible - easy to find and use</li>
      <li>Single-sourced - defined in one authoritative place</li>
    </ul>

</ul>

## Introduction to System Design  
What is a software system design? Why do we perform software system design? 

<ul>
  <li>Software system design is the creation of a plan for how a system will meet its goals - either as a physical structure or a process</li>
  <li>We perform design to provide detailed data that enables implementation aligned with system architecture, ensuring structure and behaviour are well-defined</li>
</ul>

What are the general design viewpoints?  

<ul>
  <li>Functional - actions the system performs (flows, sequences)</li>
  <li>Behavioural - how events cause system state changes</li>
  <li>Data modelling - types and structure of data used</li>
  <li>Constructional - how components are composed and connected</li>
</ul>

What are the general design strategies? What are the commonalities and differences between them? 

<ul>
  <li>General strategies</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Top-down - break big problems into smaller ones</li>
      <li>Bottom-up - build from small parts to full system</li>
      <li>Iterative/incremental - refine gradually</li>
      <li>Waterfall - linear, phased-based</li>
      <li>Agile - adaptive, short cycles</li>
      <li>Buy or Make - build in-house or purchase</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Commonalities - all aim to reduce complexity and guide design decisions</li>
  <li>Differences</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Top-down: structured, high redundancy, hard to integrate</li>
      <li>Bottom-up: interactive, reusable, harder to see full picture early</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

What is the design process? What phases and activities does it consist of? What are the software values?

<ul>
  <li>Design Process Phases and Activities</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Initialize definition</li>
      <li>Establish characteristics and identifiers</li>
      <li>Assess alternatives</li>
      <li>Manage the process</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Software values</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Behaviour - urgent but less important</li>
      <li>Structure (architecture) - important but less urgent</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

What are the common design strategies? How to decide which one to select? 

<ul>
  <li>Common strategies</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom development</li>
      <li>Packaged software</li>
      <li>Outsourcing</li>
    </ul>
  <li>How to choose</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Business needs (unique vs common)</li>
      <li>In-house expereince and skills</li>
      <li>Project management strength</li>
      <li>Time frame (flexible or short)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Structured Analysis and Design  
What is the Structured Analysis and Design (SAD) method?  

<ul>
  <li>Structured Analysis and Design (SAD) is a function-oriented approach to software development</li>
  <li>It models a system by breaking it down into a set of interacting processes
</li>
  <li>It remains popular today because of its clarity and simplicity</li>

</ul>

What is the purpose of Data-Flow Diagrams in SAD? What are the rules of DFD creation? Which techniques provide supplementary information to DFD?  

<ul>
  <li>Purpose of DFDs</li>
    <ul>
      <li>To represent what functions the system performs</li>
      <li>To show how data moves through the system</li>
      <li>To model transformations of inputs into outputs</li>
      <li>To understand system behaviour and its interaction with external entities</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Rules for DFD creation</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Must include at least one process</li>
      <li>No self-connections allowed</li>
      <li>Each process should have at least one input and one output data flow</li>
      <li>Data stores must connect to at least one process</li>
      <li>External entities cannot connect directly to each other</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Supplementary techniques</li>
    <ul>
      <li>CRUD Matrix – shows where each DFD process operates in the system</li>
      <li>Event List and Event-Based DFDs – define triggers that start processes</li>
      <li>Data Dictionary – provides detailed definitions of all data elements</li>
      <li>Entity Relationship Diagrams – show how data entities relate</li>
      <li>State Transition Diagrams – show changes in system states</li>
      <li>Process Specifications – provide logic behind each process using methods like structured English, decision tables, decision trees, and flowcharts</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Object-Oriented Analysis Design  
What is a class? What is an object? What are the main characteristics of an object?  

<ul>
  <li>A class is a set of objects that share a common structure, behaviour, and semantics. It acts as a contract between the abstraction and its clients</li>
  <li>An object is a tangible or conceptual entity with:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>State (its data or attributes)</li>
      <li>Behaviour (its actions or methods)</li>
      <li>Unique identity (distinguishes it from other objects)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Main characteristics of an object</li>
    <ul>
      <li>State: all properties and their values</li>
      <li>Behaviour: how the object responds to events or messages</li>
      <li>Identity: a unique identifier distinguishing it from other objects</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

What are the different kinds of class relationships and what purpose do they serve? 

<ul>
  <li>Dependency: one class uses another. No runtime implication, but shows one class relies on another's definition</li>
  <li>Association: a semantic relationship between classes</li>
  <li>Aggregation</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Shared Aggregation: a whole-part relationship where the part can exist independently</li>
      <li>Composite Aggregation: a stronger form where the part cannot exist independently of the whole</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Inheritance: a subclass shares structure/behaviour from a superclass. Can be single or multiple inheritance</li>
  <li>Interface Implementation: a class implements a set of abstract operations defined in an interface</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Purpose of Use Case diagrams</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Represent how a system interacts with external actors</li>
      <li>Provide a high-level view of business processes</li>
      <li>Serve as a foundation for design, testing, and interface development</li>
      <li>Can describe both current and future systems</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Main principles of defining use cases</li>
